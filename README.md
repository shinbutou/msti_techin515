The term project aimed to make real-time feedback system for tabletennis. The children device is based on the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense microcontroller. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), PDM Microphone are both integrated on the board itself. The gesture sensor APDS9960 is used to give inputs to the electronics. The machine learning algorithm can detect forehand and backhand

The parent device is based on Raspberry Pi, implementing computer vision model with a camera module. The device can register each shot in rallies, tracking the game automatically.

We have also developed a mobile application, powered by Flutter. A score board system that can track the game in real time. My main contribution to the project is the manufacturing of the paddles, which was constructed out of custom made plywood and hardwood handle. The paddle was modeled after a Wilson 3-Ply hardbat that is around
